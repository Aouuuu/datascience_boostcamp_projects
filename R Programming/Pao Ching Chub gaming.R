The project represents a simple game where the user plays against a robot in a rock-paper-scissors-like game. Here's a summary of the technique used in the code:

The start_game function is defined to initiate the game.
The game rules and instructions are displayed to the user.
Available options ("H" for Hammer, "S" for Scissors, "P" for Paper) and score variables are initialized.
A game loop is started using while(TRUE) to allow repeated plays until the user decides to quit.
Within each iteration of the loop:
The robot's move is randomly selected using the sample function.
The user is prompted for their move.
User input validation is performed to ensure valid input.
If the user chooses to quit by typing "EXIT," the game summary is displayed, and the loop is broken.
Otherwise, the user's move is compared to the robot's move to determine the outcome (win, lose, or tie).
The score variables are updated accordingly.
If the user quits the game, a game summary is displayed, including the total number of turns, tie turns, user's winning turns (score), and win rate (if applicable).
Overall, the code utilizes basic input/output operations, random selection, conditional statements, and variable manipulation to implement a simple game logic.
