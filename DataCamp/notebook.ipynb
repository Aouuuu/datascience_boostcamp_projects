There are no missing values. No changes were made to this column.\n\n**category**: The value of this column contain 6 values ( Housing, Food, Toys, Equipment, Medicine, Accessory). The missing values were replaced with “Unknown” category by using IF condition in Excel.\n\n**animal**: There were four unique values that matches the four given in the data dictionary (One of Dog, Cat, Fish, Bird). No changes were made to this column.\n\n**size**: There were Three unique values that matches the three given in the data dictionary (One of Small, Medium,Large). There are no missing value but have the mix of string format that not follow the data dictionary so, I have change all data to the exact format.\n\n**price**: The values of this column ranged from 12.85 to 54.16, which is consistent with the description given. 154 values were missing. The missing values were replaced with the median value of the remaining data, which was 28.07 and all data are rounded to two decimal.\n\n**sales**: The values of this column ranged from 286.94 to 2255.96, which is consistent with the description given. No values were missing and all data are rounded to two decimal.\n\n**rating**: The values of this column ranged from 0 to 10, which is consistent with the description given. 150 values were missing. The missing values were replaced with 0.\n\n**repeat_purchase**: There were two unique values that matches the two given in the data dictionary. There were no missing values so no changes were made to this column.","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 2","metadata":{},"id":"643d4c36-4183-4fbe-a263-6b9de60d29da","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Create a visualization that shows which is the most common type of coffee store. Use the visualization to:\n\n- State which category of the variable repeat purchases has the most observations\n- Explain whether the observations are balanced across categories of the variable repeat purchases\n![image](image.png)\n\nAccording to the graph above, the bar chart illustrates the distribution of repeat purchases across different categories. From the graph, it is evident that the **equipment category has the highest number of repeat purchases compared to other categories**. This indicates that customers are more likely to make multiple purchases in the equipment category. We can also observe that the distribution of repeat purchases appears to be relatively **balanced across the different categories**. This means that while the equipment category has the highest number of repeat purchases, the other categories still demonstrate a significant level of repeat purchases.\n\nTherefore, while the equipment category stands out with the highest number of repeat purchases, it is important for businesses to maintain a balanced focus on providing quality products and a satisfying shopping experience across all categories to effectively capture and retain customers in the competitive pet supply market.\n","metadata":{},"id":"1d5ba38c-1b3a-4f9b-bf38-bb0a62dac346","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 3","metadata":{},"id":"ce5f6df2-fbf2-4c44-9209-9ee668876b53","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Describe the distribution of all of the sales. Your answer must include a visualization that shows the distribution.\n\nThe histogram depicts the distribution of sales within the 'petsup' dataset. The x-axis represents the sales values, divided into ten equal-sized bins, while the y-axis represents the count of occurrences within each bin\n\n![image-2](image-2.png)\n\nFrom the graph, we can observe that the bars are more concentrated towards the left side of the histogram, with a longer tail extending towards the right. This suggests that the distribution of sales is **right-skewed**. A right-skewed distribution indicates that there are relatively more occurrences of higher sales values, while fewer occurrences of lower sales values. This suggests that there may be a few instances of exceptionally high sales, while the majority of sales fall within a certain range.\n\nUnderstanding the skewness of the distribution is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions. In this case, knowing that the sales distribution is right-skewed allows businesses to identify and capitalize on sales opportunities at higher price points or with higher-value products. It may also be beneficial to investigate the factors that contribute to higher sales values and leverage them to enhance sales performance further.","metadata":{},"id":"8fcff247-db49-42c0-8710-51848aeb6347","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 4","metadata":{},"id":"c5fbe3a0-d277-437c-a1a0-f1edf80684f7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Describe the relationship between repeat purchases and sales. Your answer must include a visualization to demonstrate the relationship.\n\n![image-3](image-3.png)\n\nBased on the provided scatter plot, there appears to be **a positive relationship between sales and repeat purchases.** The data points show an upward trend, suggesting that as sales increase, the total sum of repeat purchases tends to increase as well. This indicates that customers who make higher purchases are more likely to engage in repeat purchases. The positive relationship observed in the scatter plot implies that sales growth has the potential to drive customer loyalty and encourage repeat business.\n","metadata":{},"id":"170dd2ea-340f-4ab4-94c8-fe077342e98e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## ✅ When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
