I have validated all the columns against the criteria in the dataset table:\n\n- **week**: 6 weeks without missing values, same as the description. No cleaning is needed.\n- **sales_method**: 4 unique values without missing values, which contains **Email, Call, Email + Call, and em + Call**. The value **“em + Call” , “Email + Call”, “em + call”** was changed to **“Email and call”** to follow the description. By `replace function` of pandas library. Therefore, this column will have only 3 unique values.\n- **customer_id**: unique string values without missing values, same as the description. No cleaning is needed. Already recheck with `count unique` there are 15000 unique values by pandas library.\n- **nb_sold**: The values of this column ranged from 7 to 16, which is consistent with the description given. No cleaning is needed.\n- **revenue**: The values of this column ranged from 32.54 to 238.32, which is consistent with the description given. 1074 values were missing. The missing values were replaced with the mean value of the remaining data (Since the description did not specify the way to deal with missing value so, I decided to apply mean imputation technique in this time), which was 93.93 and all data are rounded to two decimals.\n- **years_as_customer**: numeric values without missing values, same as the description. Since it was stated in the data description that a corporation was started in 1984. I made the decision to presume that the data was accurate in 2023. Therefore, \"years_as_customer\" should not have a value greater than 39. Since there are two rows with values higher than 39, I choose to replace them with the value 39.\n- **nb_site_visits**:  27 unique values without missing values, same as the description. No cleaning is needed.\n- **state**: 50 unique values without missing values, same as the description. No cleaning is needed.\n\nAfter the data validation, the dataset contains **15000 rows and 8 columns** without missing values.","metadata":{},"id":"c22f7f5b-2a69-4515-8b29-7b0e94829f11","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Depending on the company goal, which is to determine the optimal sales strategy for a new product line. I'll therefore turn the conclusion into the following questions.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b7c0c2e0-489f-4cf6-a24c-ca738518de15"},{"source":"### How many customers were there for each approach?\n![Chart1](Chart1.png)\n\nFrom the last 6 weeks' record, more than half of the products were sold by \"Email method\", followed by \"Call method\". Moreover, the \"Email and call\" method has less number of customer value than the \"Email method\" about 3.0 times, which means it has a lot of room to improve.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c075e931-05b6-40e2-bbe8-c85f46d7adbd"},{"source":"Once we are aware of how many customers each selling technique generated. Let's examine the earnings from the previous six weeks for each strategy.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e857afdb-b796-4691-98b6-c54c7d344b6e"},{"source":"### What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?\n![Chart2](Chart2.png)\n![Chart3](Chart3.png)\n\nThe pricing range in the \"Email and call\" approach is more important than other methods, as seen by the several boxplots below. Compared to other techniques, the \"Email and call\" approach generates the majority of its income, which is between $150 and $175. Additionally, it was greater than the previous six-week average income. As a result, these numerous boxplots precisely demonstrate that, even though the \"Email and call\" approach generates less volume than a different method, the amount of income it generates cannot be overlook.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"35693aee-1f14-462f-b8b2-01df869f74b6"},{"source":"To consider which sales method is the best for a new product line, It should consider the revenue over time by week to see a trend of revenue for each sale method.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"854c88d3-a32a-45c6-b1f9-f13515af6dec"},{"source":"### Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?\n![Chart4](Chart4.png)\n\nThe \"email and call\" strategy has the strongest positive trend line compared to other ways, according to the aforementioned trend line. Which leads us to the conclusion that, based on how clients of the company behave, they are likely to obtain support over the phone and have time to ponder options over email.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bfc37d75-8000-49cc-8acd-697af91561a6"},{"source":"### Additional information\n\nThe number of sales made using the \"Email\" method at each step, which has more than 350 records, is another intriguing piece of information. The bar graph below demonstrates that California, Texas, New York, and Florida are the states where there is a high likelihood that the sales staff will get in touch with a customer who has not yet made a purchase but has gotten an email.\n\nBased on the aforementioned supposition, it can be deduced that a customer's behavior indicates a likelihood that they will need a service from our sales team. Accordingly, the first thing we can do right away is compile a list of customers who have yet to make a purchase of our product and then get in touch with them to provide the right product that they require.\n![Chart5](Chart5.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5b8bc29c-68cf-4788-9bc0-9b87feb12117"},{"source":"### Business Metrics\n\nSince a company's objective is to decide which sales approach is ideal for a new production line while consuming the least amount of internal resources, **I would propose using the proportion of customers who used the \"Email and call\" method in the previous 6 weeks as a business metric.**\n\nAccording to the latest six weeks of data, **18%** of consumer orders are placed by \"email and call.\" As a result, if this figure increases in the next 3-6 months, it is a very excellent indicator that a corporate target will be met.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8bfb5b81-5bc4-45e6-b9e7-8bff3411c61f"},{"source":"### **Recommendation**\n\n- **Implement Customer Feedback Mechanisms**: Gather feedback from customers who have purchased the new product line. Use surveys, reviews, or direct communication to understand their satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and gather insights for future sales tactics.\n- **Experiment with Sales Tactics:** Test different sales tactics for the new product line. Implement A/B testing to compare the effectiveness of various approaches, such as different sales methods, pricing strategies, or marketing campaigns. Use the data collected to optimize sales tactics based on the most successful outcomes.\n- **Data Collection for in-depth analysis: t**o conduct a thorough study and generate segmentation for a set of users, sales data from product categories and product name should be included, along with the specifics from the state.
